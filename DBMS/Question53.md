#### What is the GROUP BY clause in SQL? How is it used with aggregate functions?


- The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.


##### The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:

<b>MIN() -</b> returns the smallest value within the selected column
<b>MAX() -</b> returns the largest value within the selected column
<b>COUNT() -</b> returns the number of rows in a set
<b>SUM() -</b> returns the total sum of a numerical column
<b>AVG() -</b> returns the average value of a numerical column
