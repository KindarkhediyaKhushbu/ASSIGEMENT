### Explain the advantages of using views in SQL databases.

##### dvantages of View:
<b>Complexity:</b> Views help to reduce the complexity. Different views can be created on the same base table for different users.

<b>Security:</b> It increases the security by excluding the sensitive information from the view.

<b>Query Simplicity:</b> It helps to simplify commands from the user. A view can draw data from several different tables and present it as a single table.

<b>Consistency:</b> A view can present a consistent, unchanged image of the structure of the database. Views can be used to rename the columns without affecting the base table.

<b>Data Integrity:</b> If data is accessed and entered through a view, the DBMS can automatically check the data to ensure that it meets the specified integrity constraints.

<b>Storage Capacity:</b> Views take very little space to store the data.

<b>Logical Data Independence:</b> View can make the application and database tables to a certain extent independent.
