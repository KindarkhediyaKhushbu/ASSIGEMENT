### Explain the concept of JOIN in SQL. What is the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN?  

- There are many types of Joins in SQL. Depending on the use case, we can use different type of SQL JOIN clause. Below, we explain the most commonly used join types with syntax and examples:

 <b>1.INNER JOIN :</b>
 - The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both the tables as long as the condition is satisfied.

 <b>2.LEFT JOIN :</b>

 - LEFT JOIN returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matches rows for the table on the right side of the join.

 <b>3.RIGHT JOIN :</b>
 - RIGHT JOIN returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the join and matching rows for the table on the left side of the join.
