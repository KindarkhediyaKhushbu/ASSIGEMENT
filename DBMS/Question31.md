### What isthe importance of the WHERE clause in UPDATE and DELETE operations?

##### 1. Importance in UPDATE:
- The UPDATE command modifies existing data in a table. If you don't use a WHERE clause, every row in the table will be updated with the new values.

- By using the WHERE clause, you can ensure that only the specific rows that meet a certain condition are updated.

##### Example:
```sql
    UPDATE employees
    SET salary = 50000;
```

##### 2. Importance in DELETE:
- The DELETE command removes rows from a table. If no WHERE clause is provided, all rows in the table will be deleted.

- The WHERE clause allows you to specify a condition to delete only specific rows, avoiding the accidental loss of all data in the table.

```sql
    DELETE FROM employees;
```
