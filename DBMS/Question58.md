### Explain the advantages of using stored procedures.

<b>Advantages :</b>


<b>Better Performance –</b> The procedure calls are quick and efficient as stored procedures are compiled once and stored in executable form.Hence the response is quick. The executable code is automatically cached, hence lowers the memory requirements.

<b>Higher Productivity –</b> Stored Procedure helps to encapsulate the SQL logic and business logic due to which it provide reusability and modularity.

<b>Ease of Use –</b> To create a stored procedure, one can use any Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Then, they can be deployed on any tier of network architecture.

<b>Scalability –</b> Stored procedures increase scalability by isolating application processing on the server.

<b>Maintainability –</b> Maintaining a procedure on a server is much easier then maintaining copies on various client machines, this is because scripts are in one location.

<b>Security –</b> Access to the Oracle data can be restricted by allowing users to manipulate the data only through stored procedures that execute with their definer’s privileges.
