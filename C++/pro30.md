###  What are function prototypes in C++? Why are they used?


A function prototype in C++ is a declaration of a function that specifies its name, return type, and the types of its parameters, but does not include the function body.

<b>Syntax of a Function Prototype :</b>

return_type function_name(parameter_list);

<b>The Function prototype is necessary to serve the following purposes: </b>

1. Function prototype tells the return type of the data that the function will return.

2. Function prototype tells the number of arguments passed to the function.

3. Function prototype tells the data types of each of the passed arguments.

4. Also, the function prototype tells the order in which the arguments are passed to the function.

5. Therefore essentially, the function prototype specifies the input/output interface to the function
