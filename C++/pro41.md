### . Explain the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, rather than functions or logic. Here are the key concepts of OOP:

### 1. Classes :
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

### 2. Objects
- An object is an instance of a class. It is the actual entity that stores data and performs operations as defined by the class.

### 3. Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. 

### 4. Abstraction
- Abstraction is the principle of hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary features or methods. It helps to simplify the interaction with complex systems.

### 5. Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a new class can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class. The new class is called a subclass (or child class), and the class it inherits from is the superclass (or parent class).

### 6. Polymorphism
- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. There are two types of polymorphism:
- Method Overloading: Multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
- Method Overriding: A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

### 7. Composition
- Composition is the concept of creating complex objects by combining simpler objects. In this case, a class can contain instances of other classes as its attributes, rather than inheriting from them.

### 8. Association
- Association is a relationship between two objects. It can be of various types:
- One-to-One: One object is related to one other object.
- One-to-Many: One object is related to multiple objects.
Many-to-Many: Multiple objects are related to multiple other objects.
