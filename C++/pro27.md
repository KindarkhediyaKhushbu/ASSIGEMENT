### What is a function in C++? Explain the concept of function declaration, definition, and calling.

- A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

- You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

- Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

<b> Call a function </b>

- To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ;

<b>function Declaration and Definition</b>

- Declaration: the return type, the name of the function, and parameters 
- Definition: the body of the function 

### Example:

```c
// Function declaration
    void myFunction();

    int main() 
    {
        myFunction();  // call the function
        return 0;
    }       
```
